#Reflect on what was hard/easy, problems you solved, helpful tutorials you read, etc.
#Was this your first time working on a project with such file structure? If yes, how do you feel about it?
#Was this your first time using relative paths? If yes, can you tell why they are important for reproducibility purposes?
#Was this your first time using an R script? If yes, what do you think about just writing
code?
#What things were hard, even though you saw them in class/lab?
#What was easy(-ish) even though we havenâ€™t done it in class/lab?
#Did anyone help you completing the assignment? If so, who?
#How much time did it take to complete this HW?
#What was the most time consuming part?
#Was there anything interesting?

#iT IS MY FIRST TIME SO I FEEL A BIT UNCOMFORTABLE AS IT IS SOMETHING I DO NOT DOMINATE. IT WAS ALSO MY FIRST TIME USING RELATIVE PATHS AND I CONSIDR IT IS IMPORTANT AS IT ALLOWS TO ORGANIZE AND REPRODUCE BACK THE PROJECT STEP BY STEP. IT WAS MY FIRST TIME USING RSCRIPT BUT I FELT COMFORTABLE USING IT. IT WAS REALLY HARD TO ACHIEVE GROPUING VARIABLES BY TEAM AND DEVELOPING THE GGPLOTS. PCA WAS ALSO SOMETHING I STRUGGLED WITH. ANDY, THE GSI, HELPS ME TO COMPLETE THE ASSIGMENT AND I SPENT MANY HOURS (5-10) FOR COMPLETING THE HOMEWORKS. IT IS INTERESTING THAT EACH TIME THE OUTPUT IS MORE USEFUL FOR REAL LIFE APPLICATION.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
